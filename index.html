								<p>Background and Defining the Problem.<br>As part of the E-board (Executive Board) as the Treasurer of the MSU Indonesian Student Association (PERMIAS), I was able to take responsibility for our annual Fundraising project that was held in February on the MSU campus. Our purpose for holding the fundraiser was to raise money in preparation for the next school year’s executive board. We wanted the next executive board to be welcomed with an already set base amount of funds to help them run their year easier and successfully. At a stall, our fundraiser sold Indonesian sweet snacks to appeal to our Indonesian member audience who probably miss the taste of their home food and also to the audience that might not know about this snack to give them a new taste and share our Indonesian culture. Our final goal was to sell out all our products and make more than the previous fundraiser which raised $130.</p>

									<li>The reason why I was brought onto this project was because I saw it as an opportunity to gain the experience of taking on a leadership role. My club members and I naturally passed the responsibility of this project to me for I had a large part to play being the Treasurer and I was also the one who suggested the fundraiser makeup.</li>
									<li>This project’s objective was to raise enough money to make up for the funds we had spent throughout the semester from other non profit events we had held, however it was also a worry for we were not sure how much money we would be able to make. One of the biggest concerns of running a university organization is finding sponsorship or funding to hold association events and activities; so through this fundraiser we wanted to secure an amount of funding to provide assistance  for the next year.</li>

								<p>The Quest.<br>Throughout this project, I was able to participate in its work from beginning to end at a large part and it all started from my suggestion being accepted at one of our club’s weekly meetings. After brainstorming ideas for our fundraisers, my Indonesian street snack idea was chosen as one project that would be executed. Our first obstacle was figuring out how many people would be interested in buying our product and deciding how much food we should make. We wanted to make enough to reach our goal, but not too much that it would  waste our time, effort, and resources. Therefore as research before the event date, we did online promotion and specially reached out to PERMIAS members for online reservations of the product. Through these online reservations we were able to gauge the amount of food we should make, and a per person distribution that would fit the cost, have customer satisfaction, and make a suitable amount of profit. On the day of the event, a stall was set up in the MSU Wells Hall facility for passing students/faculty to buy, and for online reservation buyers to pick up, Indonsian street snacks called Martabak and Kue Pukis.</p>

								<p>The Final Solution.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Almost no costs were wasted in the making of this project for all our products were sold, and no time was wasted, only put into the development process and the expected amount of allotted time we had at the stall.</li>
									<li>Our fundraiser was able to surpass the goal of the previous and made around $600 total; $230 from online reservations and $330 from on the spot orders.</li>

								<p>Next Steps and Learning<br>Reflecting on this project, I was glad to be able to take on this opportunity of a leadership position for I learned much about management and teamwork. This project helped me learn some of the basic steps of project management and specifically in a funds earning environment. Steps such as learning how to promote a project and customer management are skills that I plan to reflect back on in the future, but the biggest skill I feel I earned was learning how to plan and organize a project from start to finish. Before this project, I had never taken such a significant role in teamplay so being the one to constantly raise up questions and make decisions gave me a huge sense of leadership that I had never experienced before. Notes I would take for if I were to do this project again would be to lower costs and higher product quantity. This was something that our team later realized, but despite our success of selling out all the products this time, customers recommended lowering the costs and we acknowledge and agree on this thought.</p>

							<p>Background and Defining the Problem.<br>I'm someone that's never coded html or css before so doing this project was very new to me and therefore I learned a lot. For my portfolio, I used a template as a base and changed a couple things to personalize it as my own portfolio. From the gif that I added, you can see that my portfolio has icons as main parts of navigation, and although there are hover descriptions, without them you will still be able to tell each page that I have through the icons. In my project specifically, I worked with adding icons connected with hyperlinks instead of just adding icons themselves in text for example.</p>
							<h3><strong>O</strong>bjective</h3>
							<div>
								<img style="float:right;" src="images/img9.png"  alt="" />
								<img style="float:right;" src="images/img10.png"  alt="" />
							</div>
							<p>Understanding your Users.<br>What I tried to achieve by using icons in my portfolio is to make my portfolio more visually appealing. I think that icons are very important in web design and UX because they are visual indications that sum up a function or category with a simple picture rather than words that may look crowded or just confusing. You can see the efficiency of using icons from these few pictures that I added. I'm sure all of you will recognize these couple icons immediately as download, information, mail, or Twitter. We use many icons for navigating and it makes the user experience both convenient and visually appealing. Because I think icons are important in this way, I definitely wanted to include them in my portfolio project, and I was able to learn about how to add them as navigation functions from the template html file.</p>
							<h3><strong>W</strong>ork</h3>
							<div>
								<img style="float:right;" src="images/img11.png"  alt="" />
							</div>
							<p>The Quest.<br>The simplest method to adding icons is using an icon library. Examples of free icon libraries you can download from font awesome and bootstrap which I have added links to. An icon library is something you can download from these sites and basically what it will be is a CSS file with a very long list of code, and including this file in your html folder will let you be able to use the free icons they provide for you.</p>
							<div>
								<img style="float:right;" src="images/img12.png"  alt="" />
							</div>
							<p>How you format your code to use this icon library in your html code starts from making sure you include the icon library in your head. This picture is an example from font awesome and how you code to include their FONTS, so it's a little bit different from icons, but still really similar. What I found was the most important to include is the part under body which is "i class= "fas/far/fal" fa-user"</p>
							<div>
								<img style="float:right; width: 50%;" src="images/img14.png"  alt="" />
							</div>
							<p>An example from w3 schools is also similar where you have "i class" and then depending on what the icon is named, it would be cloud, heart, car etc. And on font awesome or bootstrap, you will be able to see the icon and the name of it so you will be able to know what name to use when you code it.</p>
							<div class="image centered">
								<img style="width: 50%;" src="images/img13.png"  alt="" />
							</div>
							<div>
								<img style="float:right; width:50%;" src="images/img7.gif"  alt="" />
							</div>
							<p>Using my portfolio as an example, the code looks a little different because instead of using the i reference, I used an a reference because the use of my icons also connected to my hyperlinks. So when I would click on the home, folder or mail icon, it would navigate to that page. And you can see in my code that I have the class="icon solid fa- home, folder, envelope similar to the code I explained in the previous slide.</p>
							<div class="image centered">
								<img src="images/img16.png"  alt="" />
							</div>
							<div>
								<img style="float:right;" src="images/img17.png"  alt="" />
							</div>
							<p>The style of the icon is coded in the stylesheet of my html file which I added using the link and rel reference. And the gif just shows where I located my css file which matches the part in the code that says href = assets/css/main.css
							</p>
							<div class="image centered">
								<img style="width:50%;" src="images/img18.gif"  alt="" />

							<p>Next Steps and Learning<br>Reflecting on this project, my first time coding HTML/CSS was a huge learning experience that I hope to develop further into a skill that will be useful in the workfield. I plan on learning more about the other use of icons such as branded icons or icons used for buttons. Even learning how to create self designed icons will be another learning step that I look forward to taking.</p>
